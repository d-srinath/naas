Thank you for the update.
As per the KBase article, it mentions that the ipForwarding: Global setting applies to clusters built on OpenShift 4.14 and later.
Our clusters were originally built around OpenShift 4.3/4.4 and later upgraded.
Previously, we tested routingViaHost: true, but we did not apply ipForwarding: Global.
Before proceeding further, could you please confirm whether ipForwarding: Global is required in our case given the original cluster build version?
We would like to ensure this setting is applicable before making additional changes in production.
Thank you.
