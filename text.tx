As per the latest Red Hat documentation, I do not see any update indicating that DFS is supported. DFS is still listed under the limitations for the SMB CSI driver.
If needed, we can open a case with Red Hat Support to reconfirm whether there have been any recent changes.
Thanks,

Hi Eli,
As per the documented limitations, DFS is not supported. However, a standard SMB share (direct UNC path) should be supported by the SMB CSI driver.
Since we do not see any specific restriction for non-DFS SMB shares, we can proceed with a small POC to validate mounting and writing from a pod before confirming fully.
Thanks,
Sai
