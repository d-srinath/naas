Thank you for the update.
To clarify, we are not using the OpenShift EgressIP feature in this environment. There are no EgressIP resources configured.
Each worker node has a secondary NIC configured for specific backend subnets. Prior to the SDN → OVN migration, traffic destined for those subnets correctly routed via the secondary interface based on the host routing table.
After migration to OVN-Kubernetes, traffic that should egress via the secondary NIC is instead exiting through the primary interface, even though the host routing table appears correct.
This appears to be a routing behavior issue rather than an EgressIP configuration issue.
Please advise on the correct approach for ensuring traffic respects the secondary NIC routing in OVN.
Thank you.
